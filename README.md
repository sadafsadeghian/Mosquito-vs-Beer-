# Mosquito-vs-Beer-
Does Beer make humans more attractive to Mosquitoes?  Python simulation based on data recorded for the study: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20209056

This project has been done as part of University of Waterloo's Data Science program: Statistics for Data Science. 

As stated on the original study, data were collected by grouping people in two: One group were given water, while the other group were given Beer. The number of mosquitoes which bit each person were counted and the data was formed and used in this simulation.

In this simulation it is considered that the mosquitos were biting humans randomly. The numbers of mosquitos were shuffled randomly over 50000 iterations. The number of mosquitos were then averaged for the two groups and the difference between the averages were plotted to view its ditribution over the 50000 iterations. 


From the results of the 50000 iterations, it is concluded that the difference between the average number of mosquiotes biting people who had Beer vs the average number for people who had water is significant enough. Therefore as discussed on the original paper (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20209056), Beer consumption does attract more mosquitoes.
